# PythonRecipeWebsite
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For this project I created a website for users to create a database of Recipes for their future use using Python and PyCharm. Users were able to create, edit, and delete these recipes with full functionality on the website. I used both frontend and backend techniques for this project, for both styling and database management. I utilized AzureDevops to complete the stories needed and to engage with my team.</p>

<h2>Project Details</h2>
<p>Here is an example of the base for my website which includes a navigation bar for users to create and read new recipes. I also was able to include a BeautifulSoup feature to scrape information about cooking, and also link an API feature to give random advice to users who select this page.</p><br>
